Given that the maximum number of games a King player can play is 20, i.e., \( k_{\text{max}} \leq 20 \), I know the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The first winning King won 1 game.
    \item The second winning King won 20 games.
\end{itemize}

Now, my goal is to find the largest possible number of games that a single King's player could have won.

Since the second King won 20 games, and considering that no player can play more than 20 games, the largest number of games a single King could win is \( 20 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]
